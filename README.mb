# DoubleML: AI x Econometrics Project

This project demonstrates how **modern machine learning** can be used to solve **econometric causal inference problems**.  
It implements **Double/Debiased Machine Learning with Instrumental Variables (DML-PLIV)** and the **R-learner** to estimate:
- **Average Treatment Effects (ATE)** under endogeneity,
- **Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE)** for heterogeneity,
- and evaluates **policy targeting gains**.
